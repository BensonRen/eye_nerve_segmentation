Torchvision
pandas
scipy
scikit-learn


## To-do list: 
- [x] make the README file explaining the project 
- [x] understand the type of data that I need in this project
- [x] make the helper function to read and load pictures into Pytorch dataset
- [x] make the helper function to read labels into Pytorch dataset
- [x] start finish the Unet model
- [x] Debug and run the training module
- [x] Work on GPU version of minimal training product
- [x] Add loss monitoring
- [x] Solve the environment issue
- [x] Add evaluation module
- [x] Split the dataset
- [x] Change the epoch based training into mini-batch based training
- [x] Debug the train test split and pre-processing
- [x] Try full datasets training
- [x] Change the time recorder from epoch base to batch-base
- [ ] Debug the full dataset training bottleneck
